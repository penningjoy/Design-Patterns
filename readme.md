﻿Design Patterns
 
 ```
 There are altogether 23 Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns. These design patterns are categorized in 3 groups: 
  
   i.   Creational -- Creational Design patterns provide a way to create objects without revealing the creation 
                      logic. This brings in flexibility to decide which objects are important and only they can
                      be created.
        
   ii.  Structural -- Structural Design Patterns deal mainly with the structure of the classes and objects. It takes 
                       into account the concepts of inheritence, abstraction, interfaces to create and modify 
                       objects.
                      
   iii. Behavioral -- Behavioural Design Patterns are about the objects behaving and communicating with each other.
